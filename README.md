👋 Hi, I’m **Neko Indie** *(@boobosua)*
 
👀 I’m interested in game development and game design, especially in pixel art games.
 
🌱 I’m currently learning:
* Programming Language: C/C++, C#, Python, Rust, Lua, Golang, React-native

* Game Framework: PyGame, Raylib
* Design: Aseprite, Procreate, Pixaki 4
